  <H2>CAPRI Graphical User Interface</H2>

  <P>by <B>Wolfgang Britz</B>, University Bonn and <B>Alexander Gocht</B>, vTI Braunschweig</P>
  <P>1999-2011</P>

  <P>We gratefully acknowledge the support of the EU Commission -
  mainly based on the projects CAPRI, CAP-STRAT, CAPRI-Dynaspat, CAPRI-RD -
  and the helpful feedback of the users.</P>

  <H2>External libs</H2>

  <P>The code of the GUI embeds classes from many libraries available as open source, e.g. (in alphabetical order):</P>
  <UL>
     <LI>flowmap - flowmap layout</LI>
     <LI>jFreeChart - plotting</LI>
     <LI>geotools - shapefile handling</LI>
     <LI>svnkit - software versioning integration</LI>
     <LI>WEKA - Machine learning</LI>
  </UL>

  <P>In several cases, the original source code was updated
  to allow integration into the CAPRI GUI. Errors are
  hence most probably due to us. We would like to thank the
  developers of these libs for their efforts and the open
  source policy.</P>
